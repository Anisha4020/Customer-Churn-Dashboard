# 📊 Customer Churn Analytics Dashboard
An interactive and insight-driven Power BI dashboard designed to analyze customer churn behavior—focusing on retention trends, risk segmentation, contract types, payment methods, and revenue impact.

2️⃣ Short Description
The **Customer Churn Analytics Dashboard** is a visually engaging Power BI report created to help understand why customers leave, identify high-risk segments, and uncover key behavioral patterns.
It enables data-driven decision-making for improving customer retention, optimizing contracts, and enhancing revenue stability.

3️⃣ Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
📊 Power BI Desktop– Primary platform for building interactive dashboards
📂 Power Query– Used for data cleaning, transformation, and preparation
🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)– For calculated measures such as churn rate, KPIs, and averages
🧩 Data Modeling – Relationships across customer, contract, payment, and tenure data
📁 File Formats – '.pbix' for development and '.png' for dashboard preview

4️⃣ Data Source
Source:Public customer churn dataset (telecom-style customer data). The dataset contains customer-level information including:
* Customer demographics
* Tenure (months)
* Contract type
* Payment method
* Monthly charges
* Churn status
This data structure allows detailed churn analysis across multiple customer attributes and business dimensions.

5️⃣ Features / Highlights

* How does tenure affect churn probability?
* Do contract types or payment methods influence churn?
* Which customer groups pose the highest business risk?

Answering these questions using raw data is time-consuming and inefficient.
